description: Grist is the evolution of spreadsheets.
---

Grist is a modern relational spreadsheet. It combines the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the robustness of a database.
way, it has the following features:

#### Features

Grist is a hybrid database/spreadsheet, meaning that:

  - Columns work like they do in databases: they are named, and they hold one kind of data.
  - Columns can be filled by formula, spreadsheet-style, with automatic updates when referenced cells change.

This difference can confuse people coming directly from Excel or Google Sheets. Give it a chance! There's also a [Grist for Spreadsheet Users](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-for-spreadsheet-users/) article to help get you oriented. If you're coming from Airtable, you'll find the model familiar (and there's also our [Grist vs Airtable](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-v-airtable/) article for a direct comparison).

Here are some specific feature highlights of Grist:

  * Python formulas.

    - Many [Excel functions](https://support.getgrist.com/functions/) also available.
    - An [AI Assistant](https://www.getgrist.com/ai-formula-assistant/) specifically tuned for formula generation (using OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo or [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) via <a href="https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python">llama-cpp-python</a>).
  * A portable, self-contained format.
    - Based on SQLite, the most widely deployed database engine.

    - [Attachments](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns), to include media or document files in records.
    - Dates and times, toggles, and special numerics such as currency all have specialized editors and formatting options.

  * Drag-and-drop dashboards.
    - [Charts](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-chart/), [card views](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-card/) and a [calendar widget](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-calendar/) for visualization.

    - [Widget linking](https://support.getgrist.com/linking-widgets/) streamlines filtering and editing data.
    Grist has a unique approach to visualization, where you can lay out and link distinct widgets to show together,
    without cramming mixed material into a table.
    - [Filter bar](https://support.getgrist.com/search-sort-filter/#filter-buttons) for quick slicing and dicing.
  * [Incremental imports](https://support.getgrist.com/imports/#updating-existing-records).
